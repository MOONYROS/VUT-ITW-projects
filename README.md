# VUT-ITW-projects (2022/2023)

Goal of these 2 projects was to learn how to use `HTML` and `CSS` languages, to create modern webpages and to understand the basics about web development.
This subject had **2 assignments** (projects):

1. Create a style (with partial responsivness), that will match the template.
2. Create your own portfolio (or for someone else), using `HTML`, `CSS` and `Javascript` without any frameworks.

## Tasks

The first task (in `proj1/.`) was to make a `CSS` style that will match the template (`sablona.png`) and that will also have some partional responsiveness (according to specifications in the submission).
Maximum amount of recieved points was **20**.

The second task (in `proj2/.`) was to make my own portfolio (as best as I can), while only using `HTML`, `CSS` and some basic `Javascript`.
Maximum recieved amount of points was **30**.

## Final evaluation

- project 1: 12.5/20
- project 2: 30/30
