        <h2>My name is Ondřej. Glad you stopped by!</h2>
        <p>
            My programming experience started to form about 3 years ago in high school.
            I programmed a game in Unity as my final thesis, but now my scope regarding programming has greatly expanded.
            I don"t have a real job experience yet, but I sure am looking for one because nothing will teach me like practice!

                <h2>High school</h2>
                <p>
                    I studied at the general eight-year grammar school in Boskovice.
                    It was here that I first encountered programming and it was also here that I first became interested in it.
                    Back then I started by programming applications in Python.
                    I wasn't the best at it, but that didn't stop me.
                    I was so interested in it that I decided to do my final thesis in Information Technology and continue my studies in this field.

                <p>
                    I decided to continue with my interest in programming by applying to BUT FIT.
                    And here I am still studying and pushing my own limits every day.
                    Due to my low experience in the past, the start here was really very challenging and till now I am facing big obstacles.
                    However, to this day, none of them have defeated me and I am confident that I will get to my bachelor's degree and then be able to go on to my master's degree.

            <h2>What do I enjoy</h2>
            <p>
                When I can and have time, I like to spend my time in a quieter way.
                I'll play something with friends and lately I've taken a liking to watching and reviewing movies.
                Most of all though, I'm interested in new smart technologies, both hardware and software.

        <h2>What is behind me</h2>
        <p>
            Even though I don't have a myriad of projects under my belt, I think I will do well.
            I have worked with a large number of programming languages such as C, C++, C#, Python, SQL or PHP.
            But I also programmed in low-level lamguages like assembly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I'm trying to gain experience in building applications because over time I find that I enjoy it the most.
            I have tried making applications mainly in QT framework, but now I am also trying to work with C# and I plan to learn programming in React and React Native.
        </p>

            where I'm been gradually adding my projects that I've worked on either alone or as part of a team.
