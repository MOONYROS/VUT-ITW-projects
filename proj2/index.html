                My programming experience started to form about 3 years ago in <span>high school</span>.
                I programmed a game in Unity as my final thesis, but now my scope regarding programming has <span>greatly</span> expanded.
                I don't have a real job experience <span>yet</span>, but I sure am looking for one because nothing will teach me like <span>practice</span>!

                    <h3>High school</h3>
                    <p>
                        I studied at the general <span>eight-year grammar school</span> in Boskovice.
                        It was here that I first encountered programming and it was also here that I first became interested in it.
                        Back then I started by programming applications in <span>Python</span>.
                        I wasn't the best at it, but that didn't stop me.
                        I was so interested in it that I decided to do my final thesis in Information Technology and continue my studies in this field.

                        I decided to continue with my interest in programming by applying to <span>BUT FIT</span>.
                        And here I am still studying and pushing my own limits every day.
                        Due to my low experience in the past, the start here was really very challenging and till now I am facing big obstacles.
                        However, to this day, <span>none of them</span> have defeated me and I am confident that I will get to my bachelor's degree and then be able to go on to my master's degree.

                <h3>What do I enjoy</h3>
                <p>
                    When I can and have time, I like to spend my time in a quieter way.
                    I'll play something with friends and lately I've taken a liking to watching and reviewing movies.
                    Most of all though, I'm interested in new smart technologies, both hardware and software.

            <h2>What is behind me</h2>
            <p>
                Even though I don't have a myriad of projects under my belt, I think I will do well.
                I have worked with a large number of programming languages such as <span>C</span>, <span>C++</span>, <span>C#</span>,
                <span>Python</span>, <span>SQL</span> or <span>PHP</span>.
                But I also programed in low-level languages like <span>assembly</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now I'm trying to gain experience in building applications because over time I find that I enjoy it the most.
                I have tried making applications mainly in <span>Qt&nbsp;framework</span>, but now I am also trying to work with <span>C#</span> and I plan
                to learn programming in <span>React</span> and <span>React&nbsp;Native</span>.
            </p>
            <p>

                where I'm gradually adding my projects that I've worked on either alone or in a team with others.
